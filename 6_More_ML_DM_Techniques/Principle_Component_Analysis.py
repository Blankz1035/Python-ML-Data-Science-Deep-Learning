# PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique:
# it lets you distill multi-dimensional data down to fewer dimensions,
# selecting new dimensions that preserve variance in the data as best it can

# Example using IRIS dataset. This DS has a total of 4 dimensions.
# We will do PCA on this to transform the DS into a lower dimension ratio and review the results.
